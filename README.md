Ponder is a decentralized exchange protocol built for Bitkub Chain. The protocol builds on Uniswap V2's foundation while adding comprehensive safety features, reliable price feeds, and yield farming powered by the PONDER token.

The protocol centers on automated market making, where liquidity providers deposit pairs of tokens into pools that enable trading. Each trade goes through multiple safety checks including price impact limits and emergency stops for extreme situations. The system maintains a time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracle, tracking prices over time to provide manipulation-resistant data feeds that other protocols can use.

## PONDER Token

The PONDER token forms the backbone of the protocol's economic system, featuring:

- Maximum supply: 1 billion PONDER
- Distribution period: 4 years from deployment
- Minting: Controlled by MasterChef contract
- Utility: Farming rewards and governance (planned)
- Boosts: Up to 3x reward multipliers

## Farming Mechanics

The farming system in Ponder brings several key features:

- Liquidity providers earn PONDER by staking LP tokens
- Users can stake PONDER to boost their farming rewards
- Each pool has configurable allocation points for rewards
- Deposit fees (up to 10%) are directed to treasury
- Emergency withdrawals available for immediate fund access
- Auto-compounding rewards across pools
